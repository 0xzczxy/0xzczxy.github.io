## About Me

I enjoy diving deep into how systems really work—from bootloaders and firmware to hypervisors and kernel-level code. My projects focus on understanding and extending system boundaries, always with an educational and research mindset.

**Interests:**
- UEFI/BIOS Development
- Hypervisor & Virtualization Technology
- Windows Internals
- Reverse Engineering
- Ethical Hacking

## Projects

### [ZczxyPkg](https://github.com/0xzczxy/ZczxyPkg)
A collection of UEFI drivers and research projects exploring low-level Windows functionality. This package includes experimental drivers that interact with Windows boot processes and system components.

**Featured Component:**
- **ExtendedHv**: A UEFI runtime driver that extends Windows Hyper-V functionality by injecting code into the hypervisor at boot time. This project demonstrates advanced PE manipulation, position-independent code injection, and VT-x/AMD-V interaction.
